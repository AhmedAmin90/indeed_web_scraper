# indeed_web_scraper



**For this project I created a web scraper that returns a list of Web developer Jobs that are posted in [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/). This will help newly graduated students from Microverse and other Job seekers to keep their eyes focus on posted jobs in an easy way.**

### I used in this application:
- Ruby.
- Ruby RSpec.
- Nokogiri Gem.
- HTTParty Gem.
- Rainbow Gem.
- Whirly Gem.

## How to use the application:

**Make sure Ruby is installed on your computer**

- Open The Terminal.
- Clone the project to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/AhmedAmin90/indeed_web_scraper
```
- Install required Gems:

```
gem install RSpec 
gem install httparty 
gem install nokogiri
gem install rainbow
gem install whirly 
```
- To run the application: Go to The bin folder and open the terminal and run it by:
```
 ruby bin/main.rb
 ```
